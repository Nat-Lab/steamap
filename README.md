steamap: Interactive Steam Friend map
---

This is an interactive Steam friend relationship map. 

To use it, visit [lab.nat.moe/steamap](http://lab.nat.moe/steamap/index.html). Supply API key and a SteamID64 to get started, then click on any node to draw their friends on the map. Alternatively, hit Enter to add users to map.

You'll need a Steam Web API key. Get one [here]( http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey). To get SteamID64 for a user, visit their profile page with `?xml=1` appended to the end of the URL. (e.g. `http://steamcommunity.com/id/maho_morichika?xml=1`)

Notice that Cross-Origin restrictions need to be disabled for API calls to work.
